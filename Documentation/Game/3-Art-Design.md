# Art Design

## Art Design Tooling

- Blender
    - Villagen plugin for settlement creation
    - [machin3tools](https://blendermarket.com/products/MACHIN3tools)
    - [Synth](https://www.blendermarket.com/products/kit-ops-synth)
    - [Botaniq](https://blendermarket.com/products/botaniq-trees)

## Visual and Auditory Elements

The art-style will be defined principally by the following elements:

### Camera

- "Western Sci-Fi" aesthetic
- "Cinematic" is the watch-word; and
- A third person camera, with a relatively high angle;
- A depth of field effect that makes it look almost toy-like, or tilt-shifted;
- "Toy" like environments, possibly on a single-screen, possible with a fixed camera;
- Lots of high contrast lighting;
- In smaller spaces switch to a fixed camera that pivots to follow you, instead of being attached to you
- I love the subtle camera movements in Citizen Sleeper, making the 3D background rotate slightly as you move your cursor over the game UI elements.

### Environments

- I love the way small vehicles are flying around the space station in Citizen Sleeper. Could do something similar with drones.
- In keeping with the "diorama" aesthetic, the edges of environments will simply end suddenly, with no attempt made to disgiuse them.  You can see the thin mesh that forms the ground layer there.  An invisible wall will block your movement off the map.

### Models

- Mid poly (distinctly _not_ low poly);
- Realistic PBR materials drawn from [Physically Based](https://physicallybased.info/), BUT ...
- With no textures;
- Lots of emissive materials;
- A _Citizen Sleeper_-style color palette;
- Possibly "freeze-frame" animations (e.g., 3-4 FPS);
- Originally I had thought it would have a _stylized_, possibly _cell-shaded_, look, but now I'm not so sure - I want to move away from cell-shading, perhaps, and towards a "toy model" look, if that makes sense?
- Adapt assets purchased from Turbosquid, Pond5, etc

### Audio

- Music that is heavily themed depending on the "Age" in which it appears; starting with electronic music for the First Age, moving to tense horror, "Stalker"-themed soundtrack for the second, followed by tribal themes in the final (drawing inspiration from something like the _Journey_ soundtrack.
- SFX?
- Use music from freesound, musicbed, envato, etc

The following more incidental points will also apply:

### UI

- UI design taking inspiration from _In Other Waters_ and _Citizen Sleeper_

## Workflow Constraints

The following are hard constraints to keep to project timeline manageable: no textures, no spoken dialogue, no cutscenes (do "cutscenes in text", like Planescape Torment did), no 3D animated dialogue (all 2D pictures overlaid).  Essential animation only.  All final character modeling and animation handled by (a) third party modeler(s) and animator(s), and I might get third party assistance with environment design even though I expect to be doing a lot of it.  All concept art created by a third party concept artist.  All music and sound effects produced by a third party composer.

So what tasks fall to me?  Rough concept art, blockout modeling, placeholder animation, blockout level design, blockout environment design, all game design, all camera design (might involve pro later), final environment design, all production of design documentation (e.g., team wiki in the repo) all team coordination and process management, all reference gathering for third party artists.

I can revisit the above assumptions if it ends up getting funded.

## Art Design References

- Having really liked the color palette in Citizen Sleeper, I've adopted it for this project.
- I also really like the some of the character design elements of _Somerville_.
- I like the visual style in _The Very Pule of the Machine_, from _Love, Death and Robots_:
    - [The Very Pulse of the Machine: LoveDeathAndRobots](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveDeathAndRobots/comments/utpno9/the_very_pulse_of_the_machine/?s=8)

## Color palette

Based on the very pretty _Citizen Sleeper_.

I also love that bright red lacquered look, contrasted with gunmetal grey or black.  I want to try to work that in.

## Asset Design

For design simplicity, assets should be designed on a size grid so itâ€™s all pluggable together. Combined with the depth-of-field effect, this supports the toy-like aesthetic.  Project Zomboid might be a reference here.

Quite like that elongated human character look from Somerville.

## UI

Include great quotes on loading screens.

Stylistically i like the way that Disco Elysium handles its dialogue - talking about visually, not the complex threading. A single pane on one side of the screen, clear lovely typography scrolling down it. And character portraits.
