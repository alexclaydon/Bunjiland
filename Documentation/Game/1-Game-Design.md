# Game Design

## Game Design Tooling

- Unreal Engine 5
- Articy Draft UE plugin
- [ATBTT Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/advanced-turn-based-tile-toolkit)
- [Sky Creator Plugin](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/sky-creator) (note that with my current camera you will only see the sky at low angles)

## Principled Summary

- An Xcom-like crossed with some of Stardew Valley’s narrative elements, namely the way the quality of conversations goes up as you get to know the characters.
- Sparsity; simplicity of gameplay _systems_ will be a defining characteristic.
- I should aim for a 4 hour playtime

## Specific Features

### Dialogue

- Heavily dialogue-driven.  Lots of (Disco Elysium-style) inner monologuing.
- In dialogues, the character must have an inner voice to make observations, etc
- People only reveal their information to you as you spend time speaking with them, like Stardew Valley. The reason I like this is that it Is just fundamentally the correct way to design a character system.
- Companions that travel with you for a stint, help the story be told, then part ways, deciding to stay with the communities they meet along the way.

### Combat

- XCom-like but with weapons in various states of degradation and a move to lower technology weapons as the game progresses
- Fire burns up wooden shields?

- “Curiosity is Outer Wilds sole driving force. No missions assigned objectives or other prescriptive guidelines. Knowledge is the only game player reward. It’s also how you progress in the game.” Great quote. Could I come up with a central mechanic whereby knowledge is the sole driven of progression?  
- In the “Bartle” chart, you’re focusing on “explorer”-archetype games
- Inspire curiosity -> Reward exploration. Perhaps the reward is the story of our downfall. The Bunjiland.
